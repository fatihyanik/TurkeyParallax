        <h2>Antalya</h2>
        <p>
            Antalya; is a port city on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. It was formerly known as Adalya and to
            medieval Europe as Satalia. Picturesquely situated on steep cliffs overlooking the Gulf of Antalya, the city
            is third in importance of Turkey’s Mediterranean ports, after Mersin and iskenderun. The harbor is not deep,
            however, and only ships of very shallow draft can put into the port. All others must anchor in the roads and
            be served by tender.

            In recent years the growth of tourism has opened new avenues of development. Except for the excessive heat
            of July and August, the climate is mild and sunny throughout the year. The city’s seclusion from industry,
            its miles of beaches, its palm-shaded streets and parks, and the great wealth of relics of classical
            antiquity in its vicinity have accelerated its conversion into a Turkish “Riviera.”

            The city was founded by King Attalus II of Pergamum (reigned 159-138 b.c.) and called Attaleia. Until taken
            by the Romans in 79 b.c., it was a notorious pirate haven. It became a senatorial province of the Roman
            empire about 43 a.d., and because of the great increase in maritime activity it replaced in importance the
            older neighboring cities of the Pamphylian plain, Perge, Aspendos (Belkis), and Side. In 1207 it was taken
            from the Byzantines by the Anatolian Seljuks. About the beginning of the 14th century, Antalya passed to the
            Teke Begleri, a branch of the Turkman dynasty of the Hamidoglu, who lost it to the Ottomans in 1423.

        <h2>İzmir</h2>
        <p>
            Once the ancient city of Smyrna, Izmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a
            huge bay and surrounded by mountains. The broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and shopping centers are
            dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the
            city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

            Konak is considered the touristic center of Izmir and is full of historical mosques, the famous clock tower
            and many small streets with cafes, and restaurants.

            Sirince is a small Turkish village. Sirince is famous with beautiful white houses. As it is very close to
            Ephesus, it is recommended to see both these places in a one day trip.

            Cappadocia is a historical region in Central Anatolia, largely in the Nevşehir, Kayseri, Kırşehir, Aksaray,
            and Niğde Provinces in Turkey.

            The name, traditionally used in Christian sources throughout history, continues in use as an international
            tourism concept to define a region of exceptional natural wonders, in particular characterized by fairy
            chimneys and a unique historical and cultural heritage.
